<h1>“Things I wish I had known about R spatial” &amp; Problem solving session IV</h1>
<p>To end the year with a bang, we’re doing a double session this month.</p>
<p>We will start with a short session on Spatial Analysis in R - <strong>Things I wish I had known about R spatial</strong> by Christina Buelow.</p>
<p>For the second half we will have another <strong>problem solving session</strong>.
As with previous problem-solving sessions, we will have a free-range discussion with the goal of helping people get back on track with their geospatial data analysis.
If you have a thorny problem, feel free to send it through to Nicholas Wiggins (<a href="mailto:n.wiggins@uq.edu.au" class="email">n.wiggins@uq.edu.au</a>) ahead of the session and we will try to come up with a solution.</p>
